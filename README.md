# Alembic

Minimal demo of using the [dll-syringe](https://github.com/OpenByteDev/dll-syringe/) and [retour-rs](https://github.com/Hpmason/retour-rs) to hook Asheron's Call client functions.
Built for my curiosity.

## Plan

- [ ] Hook network send/recv
- [ ] Hook a client function like chat
- [ ] Hook DirectX
